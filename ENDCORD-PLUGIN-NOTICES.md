# Imported Endcord plugins

Source: https://github.com/rootpoii/Endcord, commit `27c2964e0ff89d4629e6541a179add0442efde1b`.

QuickDelete, RemindMe, AutoReact, SmoothType, FakeTag, FakeConnections, and the CustomProfile icon/badge asset definitions were adapted under GPL-3.0-or-later. Original copyright notices are retained in the imported source. EqyCord branding identifies the distribution, not exclusive authorship.

The Endcord developer table supplies a fallback Discord ID for unknown authors. EqyCord keeps those names but leaves unverified IDs unset rather than linking them to a different person's account.

CustomProfile was rewritten for EqyCord's APIs and lifecycle. It does not use Endcord's remote profile backend or donor-badge cache. Custom styles are separate from real Discord badges. The gifting-image URLs owned by Endcord were excluded; the shared badge selector uses the source's Discord CDN icons for the supported styles.

Existing Vencord and Equicord notices and licenses remain applicable to their original code.
