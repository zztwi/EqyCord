## Checks for this update

For this update, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passed, `pnpm test` passed all 10 tests with no failures or skips, and `pnpm buildWeb` passed. The test suite checks desktop builds, TypeScript, ESLint, CSS lint, generated plugin metadata, plugin origin assignment, duplicate names, backup parsing, original Vencord notices, and Windows installer fixtures. The standalone Windows desktop build is produced by `pnpm test`.

Canary must be updated and restarted to verify the plugin manager and plugin list show **Origin: EqyCord** with the imported cards. Canary compatibility does not establish compatibility with Stable or PTB.
