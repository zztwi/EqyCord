# EqyCord Windows setup

Share **EqyCord-Setup.exe**. It contains the tested client build, a private Node.js runtime, the checksum-pinned upstream Vencord patcher CLI, licenses, and matching EqyCord and patcher source archives. It does not contain user settings, account data, tokens, or Discord archives.

## Interface

The selected Phantom mark appears next to EqyCord, on the loading surface, and in the executable/window icon. It uses a transparent background and includes icon sizes of 16, 32, 48, and 256 pixels.

The English introduction uses EqyCord's brand and Phantom identity. The footer credits EqyCord's creator as `0009cx0` and links to `https://discord.com/users/380070146317877249`, immediately before Licenses & source. That action opens a fixed URL in the default browser; the embedded surface never accepts arbitrary URLs. Original upstream credits, source notices, and licenses are retained.

The top left shows Phantom Edition and a Help link to the EqyCord Discord community at `https://discord.gg/Kexjx2GH3B`. Help opens this fixed invite in the default browser and is also available in the native fallback. Package tests click the actual Help button and check its native bridge action and destination, with external browser launch intercepted during testing.

New desktop users receive the shared starter preset from `src/shared/eqyStarterPreset.json` automatically on their first Discord launch. It is based on the owner's approved custom settings export, including enabled plugins and plugin preferences. The saved screenshare source/thumbnail is omitted and cloud authentication, sync, and sync version are reset. This shareable preset is embedded in the client build; account data and existing personal settings directories are not packaged. An existing `settings.json` (including one from Vencord) is never replaced, and existing QuickCSS is preserved. Preferences stay editable in Settings afterward, and reinstalling does not reset them. Settings use the existing Vencord-compatible desktop data path; the preset does not install a separate Vencord client.

The setup uses a borderless English interface with a translucent installation panel. Its full-window Mesh Drift background is a WebGL shader: five drifting points carry the ground color `#DCDCD8` and accents `#F5C7B8` / `#C9D8F0`, blended by inverse distance. Hashed value noise, six-octave fbm, and a two-level domain warp soften the motion. Pointer intensity rises and relaxes smoothly. There are no simulated browser or device selectors.

Windows' reduced-motion preference renders a single frame. Resizing can redraw that frame; pointer movement does not animate it. The shader pauses when the document is hidden. If WebGL is unavailable or its context is lost, a static CSS surface appears behind the same usable controls. If the entire web surface cannot initialize, the native install/verify/uninstall interface remains available.

The executable embeds Microsoft WebView2 SDK 1.0.2903.40 and a private fixed x64 runtime 154.0.4258.62 from [Microsoft's runtime distribution](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/). Both downloads have pinned SHA-256 hashes. No global WebView2 installation or first-launch network download is required. The runtime retains its Microsoft/Chromium notices and bundled third-party license resources; it is not EqyCord-authored code. First launch extracts roughly 700 MB of runtime files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/EqyCord/setup-ui`, and later launches check their hashes. The standalone EXE is larger because it includes this runtime. Fixed runtime updates require rebuilding and distributing a new setup; the build script pins the tested version explicitly.

Only the embedded local document can send setup actions. External navigation and new windows are blocked, the content policy prohibits network requests, and action/channel inputs are checked by the native controller. No web page can supply arbitrary commands or paths.

## Install

Windows 10/11 x64 with .NET Framework 4.8 and a normal desktop Discord installation is required. Stable, PTB, and Canary are offered subject to compatibility. Microsoft Store and other layouts are not supported.

1. Close the chosen Discord client completely, including its tray icon.
2. Open EqyCord-Setup.exe and choose Stable, PTB, or Canary.
3. Click Install, then open Discord after the success message.

The setup does not install Node globally and does not require a terminal or administrator rights for normal per-user Discord installations. Files are kept in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/EqyCord/builds/<commit>`. The downloaded setup can be deleted after installation; keep the installed build folder.

Existing client mods are not overwritten. Uninstall them using their own installer first. To update this EqyCord setup installation, close Discord, uninstall the old build, then install the new one. Automatic client updates can invalidate a patch and may require reinstalling.

## Verify and restore

Verify checks the patch, original backup, and installed client files. Uninstall restores the exact original Discord archive and checks its hash; it preserves settings and source files. The setup discovers its owned installation from Discord metadata, including an older app directory after Discord updates. Unknown, modified, or foreign patches are refused.

This setup does not claim ownership of the developer's existing Desktop package or a legacy loader lacking `.eqycord-install.json`. Those must be restored with their original installer.

## Distribution and visibility

The Staff and Creator badge assignments are bundled for IDs 380070146317877249 and 1306071807815712828. Clients running this build can display them; older builds and normal Discord do not. No hosted badge service is configured.

The executable is unsigned: Windows may show an unknown-publisher or SmartScreen warning. Do not tell recipients to disable their security software. Distribute the original file and its SHA-256 checksum. No public download page is automatically created by building the executable.

EqyCord is an unofficial mod and may conflict with Discord's Terms. Original Vencord/Equicord source credits and GPL-3.0-or-later notices remain included. Node's license and the patcher's source/license are included separately.

## Build and validation

Build the standalone desktop client, commit the exact source, then run `scripts/eqycord/windows/build.ps1` in PowerShell 7 from the repository. The Windows compiler and private Node runtime are pinned in that script. The embedded payload has a manifest of file hashes; extraction refuses traversal, directory links, or changed existing files.

The `--extract-only <directory>` argument is for package tests and does not patch Discord. Test extraction, bundled-runtime install/verify/uninstall on an isolated fixture, changed-file refusal, and the user interface separately. A passing fixture test does not establish every plugin's runtime compatibility on another machine.

Run `node scripts/eqycord/windows/test-package.mjs <setup.exe>` to check the built package. It uses `--ui-test <report-directory>` to render the actual embedded surface and capture ready, error, success, reduced-motion, and static fallback PNGs. It checks WebGL compilation/rendering, selected-client actions reaching the native bridge, keyboard selection, busy controls, error recovery, pointer smoothing, and the reduced-motion single-frame path. Patching actions are intercepted during this test, so it never modifies a real Discord installation. It separately checks native fallback startup and uses `--extract-only` for fixture extraction/install/verify/uninstall. Review the generated PNGs visually; passing UI tests do not establish real-client installation on every supported channel. Fixture artifacts remain under the ignored `work` directory. `--ui-smoke` is also available for a shorter invisible startup check.
